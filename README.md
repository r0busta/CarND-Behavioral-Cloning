# Deep Learning and Behavioural Cloning

Term 1

Project 3

Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.

*Project description*

The goals/steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of a good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track number 1 without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

# Credits

* The project uses the CNN model proposed by NVIDIA in https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/

* Thanks Udacity for providing self-driving car simulator
